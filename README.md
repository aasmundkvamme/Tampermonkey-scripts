# Tampermonkey-scripts

This repository contains scripts you can run in Tampermonkey and probably in its cousins Greasemonkey and Violentmonkey. These scripts adds functionality, but without requiring you to upload anything in Canvas, so there are now changes for anybody else using Canvas. Tampermonkey scripts runs localy in your browser for your benefit.
